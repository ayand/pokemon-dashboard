# Pokémon Dashboard Project

This is a Pokémon project showing visualizations in regards to various trends in Pokémon types and stats using the visualization library D3.js.

The source of the data was converted to a JSON from a CSV file that was acquired from this link:

Note: This data has been altered to rectify some dirtiness. Some records were eliminated which could potentially have been used.
